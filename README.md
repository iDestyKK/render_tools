# Rendering Scripts

## Synopsis
Collection of rendering scripts that I use to automate content creation via
ffmpeg. This is done for archival purposes of gameplay footage.

## Renderers
Each directory has a "system" of rendering tools with very specific usages.
They are all powered by ffmpeg, though.

* **gameplay** - AVI-\>MKV for Dxtory and Fraps footage.
* **gba** - AVI-\>MKV for recordings exported from VBA-RR.
* **source-tga** - TGA Frames-\>MKV for recordings exported from Source Engine games.
